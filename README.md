This is a simple web application that allows you to search for restaurants based on a location and keyword using the Google Maps and Google Places APIs.

# Installation
ðŸ‘‰ To run this application locally, you will need to obtain a Google Maps API key and include it in the index.html file. You can obtain a free API key by following the instructions on the Google Maps Platform website.

Once you have obtained an API key, replace the placeholder YOUR_API_KEY in the index.html file with your actual API key.

# Usage
ðŸ‘‰ To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You should see a map centered on San Francisco with a search form below it.

Enter a location (e.g. "San Francisco, CA") and a keyword (e.g. "pizza") in the search form and click the "Search" button. The application will use the Google Places API to search for restaurants based on your input and display markers on the map for each restaurant found.

Clicking on a marker will display the name of the restaurant in a popup window.
